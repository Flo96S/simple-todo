## Frontend
Overview

The frontend interacts with the backend API to perform various actions on a collection of TodoItem objects. These actions include testing the API, retrieving individual items, retrieving a list of items, updating an item, deleting an item, and creating a new item.
ApiHandler Class
Properties

    URL: The base URL of the backend API. Default value is "http://localhost:9988".

Methods
Test

csharp

public async Task<string> Test()

    Sends a GET request to the "/test" endpoint of the backend API.
    Returns a string containing a randomly generated ID.

GetElement

csharp

public async Task<TodoItem> GetElement(string id)

    Sends a GET request to the "/post/:id" endpoint of the backend API, where id is the specified item ID.
    Returns a TodoItem object representing the item with the given ID.

GetElements

csharp

public async Task<List<TodoItem>> GetElements()

    Sends a GET request to the "/posts" endpoint of the backend API.
    Returns a list of TodoItem objects representing all items in the database.

UpdateElement

csharp

public async Task<int> UpdateElement(TodoItem item)

    Sends a PUT request to the "/post" endpoint of the backend API, updating the item with the specified ID.
    Returns 0 upon successful update.

DeleteElement

csharp

public async Task<bool> DeleteElement(string id)

    Sends a DELETE request to the "/post/:id" endpoint of the backend API, where id is the specified item ID.
    Returns true if the deletion is successful; otherwise, returns false.

CreateElement

csharp

public async Task<bool> CreateElement(string title, string desc, string color, string img)

    Sends a POST request to the "/post" endpoint of the backend API, creating a new item with the specified details.
    Returns true if the creation is successful; otherwise, returns false.

This ApiHandler class provides an interface for the frontend to interact with the backend API and perform CRUD operations on the TodoItem objects. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified URL for successful communication.

## Backend

Overview
The application provides a RESTful API for basic CRUD operations on a collection of items. It is structured as a Go program and is divided into several packages: database, helper, and otel. The database package handles interactions with the underlying data store, helper provides utility functions, and otel integrates OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
Dependencies

The following external packages are imported and utilized in the application:

    github.com/gin-gonic/gin: The Gin web framework for handling HTTP requests.
    go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp: OpenTelemetry instrumentation for HTTP servers.
    go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace: OpenTelemetry tracing package.

OpenTelemetry Setup

The application sets up OpenTelemetry to enable distributed tracing. It initializes the OpenTelemetry SDK with the service name "Todo" and version "0.1". The tracing is automatically wrapped around the HTTP server using the gin.WrapH middleware.
Database Initialization

The database package is initialized using database.Init(), ensuring that the application is ready to interact with the underlying data store.
API Endpoints
GET /test

    Returns a JSON response containing a randomly generated ID with a length of 32 characters.

GET /

    Returns a JSON response indicating that the API is working.

GET /posts

    Returns a JSON response containing a list of all items in the database, each represented in a shortened format.

GET /post/:id

    Returns a JSON response containing details of the item with the specified ID.

POST /post

    Adds a new item to the database based on the JSON payload received in the request.

PUT /post

    Updates an existing item in the database. Expects the ID of the item to be updated in the form data.

DELETE /post/:id

    Deletes the item with the specified ID from the database.

Run the Application

The application listens on port 9988. To start the server, run the main function in the main package. The server will be accessible at http://localhost:9988.
